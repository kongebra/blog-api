# Blog API

This will be a part-time project for building the back-end for a blog.

Front-end will be placed in another repository, which will be linked here later.

## Tech

### Programming language

#### Go

Go wil be used as I have used it earlier for my bachelor thesis, and think it a good language with many features that I like. I think it will be a good fit for this project.

### Query language

#### GraphQL

GraphQL will be used as the query language for making an single end-point for the API, and for personal development learning more about it.

### Database

Have not decided on which database I will use yet. I have the most experience with SQL databases, and think using an NoSQL database for this project would be a good challange, but I don't know which one to choose yet.

Would have to do some more research on which one to choose, until then, I'll use in-memory storage (maybe local files?)

#### NoSQL

##### MongoDB

I have used this a few times while studying, but not enough to be say that I know it well, but seems like a good option, as well as a cheap option.

**_Pros_**

-   Cheap

**_Cons_**

-   lorem ipsum

##### DynamoDB

No prior experience with DynamoDB, but have recently completed a AWS course, where this was a central subject of the course.

**_Pros_**

-   lorem ipsum

**_Cons_**

-   No experience
-   Can be costly

##### Cosmos DB

No prior experience with Cosmos DB, but are currently employeed as a .NET developer for an consultant firm, where we use Azure for many of the products we work on.

**_Pros_**

-   Heard lots of positive stuff

**_Cons_**

-   No experience
-   Expensive

## Branching strategy

### Git Flow

I will use Git Flow as branching strategy for this project for practice.

## CI/CD

Will look into GitHub Actions for CI for this, and look for alternativs for CD.
